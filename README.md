# MIÂ² - diploma thesis

So you want to do an engineering, master's, or PhD project with me?

Awesome! 

In recent years I have been a supervisor of more than 100 diploma projects, some of them finished with great results, others failed. 
Based on this experience, I have prepared some questions below to help choose and focus on those projects that can bear beautiful fruit.

- How much time per week are you able to devote to this project? 
Certainly many fantastic things can be done after hours, but my experience says that without sufficient time commitment there will be no good results.

- What is your superpower?
I do a lot of projects from software development to applications to statistical analysis of new methods. For a project to be successful it has to be based on the unique and deep skills of the people doing it. Are you a great software engineer, fluent in several languages and able to create responsible software? Are you passionate about medical applications and medicine itself? Or maybe you are interested in predictive analytics? Or maybe something else? Tell me what is your superpower.

- What preliminary results do you have so far and what is your motivation to complete it? An undergraduate engineering thesis is often one or two semesters, a master's thesis is two or three semesters of work and a PhD is often four years. Completing such projects is not a sprint but a marathon. Write me why you want to complete it?
